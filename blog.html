  <h1>This is a blog</h1>
  <p>This is <em>supposed</em> to be a blog, but that feels kind of boring, so instead, I'm going to just put down a
    couple of song lyrics.</p>

  <h2>Lovers in a Dangerous Time</h2>
  <h3><em>covered by the Barenaked Ladies, originally by Bruce Cockburn</em></h3>

  <h4>Verse 1</h4>
  <p>Don't the hours grow shorter as the days go by</p>
  <p>You never get to stop and open your eyes</p>
  <p>One day you're waiting for the sky to fall</p>
  <p>The next you're dazzled by the beauty of it all</p>

  <!-- Based on the overall simplicity of this, I'm not commenting like I should, but this is a standin reminder of commenting format in html -->
  <h4>Chorus</h4>
  <strong>
    <p>When you're lovers in a dangerous time</p>
    <p>Lovers in a dangerous time</p>
  </strong>

  <h4>Verse 2</h4>
  <p>These fragile bodies of touch and taste</p>
  <p>This vibrant skin—this hair like lace</p>
  <p>Spirits open to the thrust of grace</p>
  <p>Never a breath you can afford to waste</p>

  <h4>Chorus</h4>
  <strong>
    <p>When you're lovers in a dangerous time</p>
    <p>Lovers in a dangerous time</p>
    <p>When you're lovers in a dangerous time</p>
    <p>Lovers in a dangerous time</p>
  </strong>

  <h4>Verse 3</h4>
  <p>When you're lovers in a dangerous time</p>
  <p>Sometimes you're made to feel as if your love's a crime—</p>
  <p>But nothing worth having comes without some kind of fight—</p>
  <p>Got to kick at the darkness 'til it bleeds daylight</p>

  <h4>Chorus</h4>
  <strong>
    <p>When you're lovers in a dangerous time</p>
    <p>When you're lovers in a dangerous time</p>
    <p>And we're lovers in a dangerous time</p>
    <p>Lovers in a dangerous time</p>
  </strong>

  <h4>Outro</h4>
  <p>Lovers in a dangerous time</p>
  <p>Lovers in a dangerous time</p>
  <p>Lovers in a dangerous time</p>
